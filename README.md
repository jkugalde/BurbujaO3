## Resume

## Working principle

## Design

## Electronics

The current design has an Arduino UNO as controller, with an Arduino Sensor Shield on top to plug the other components easily, as they are all Arduino modules. It will be upgraded to a PCB with an Arduino Nano to reduce the size of the electronics case and secure the connections.

### BOM
